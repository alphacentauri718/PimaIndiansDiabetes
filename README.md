Greetings! This is my first ever machine learning project on Github! 

This project used the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset located at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/code

The labels are in the last column of the data set, called "Outcome" and the model used a simple Logistic Regression to make predictions about diabetes within 
the individuals using the given features.

There are comments in the code giving my thoughts along each step. If you have any questions though, feel free to reach out at rahulkanwar314@gmail.com!
